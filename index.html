    <!-- 
    This is the root-level index.html file.
    
    If you are developing the frontend application, please note that
    the Vite development server and build process use 'frontend/index.html' 
    as the main entry point, as configured in your 'package.json' scripts.
    
    This root-level 'index.html' file is likely not used by the Vite build 
    process for your frontend application. It previously contained an 
    importmap for 'vite' and 'path' which is not the correct way to 
    configure or use Vite, potentially leading to errors or confusion. 
    That script has been removed.
